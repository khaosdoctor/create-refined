# Bugs

# Others

- This mod shouldn't be only for Create since it just exposes RS capabilities. Consider renaming it to something more generic. Maybe "Refined Barrels" or "Refined Integrations".
- Change the name of the block from "Network Interface" to something more descriptive, "Storage Adapter" or "External Network Storage"
- Add docs
- Change the texture of the block to something better
